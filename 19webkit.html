    <p>-webkit- is simply a group that Chrome, Safari, Opera and iOS browsers fit into. They all have a common ancestor, so often their capabilities/limitations (when it comes to running CSS and Javascript) are confined to the group. </p>
        <p>
            A developer will place -webkit- followed by some code, meaning that the code will only run on Chrome, Safari, Opera and iOS browsers. Here is a complete list:
        </p>
        <p>-webkit- (Chrome, Safari, newer versions of Opera, almost all iOS browsers (including Firefox for iOS); basically, any WebKit based browser)
        </p>
        <p>-moz- (Firefox)</p>
        <p>-o- (Old, pre-WebKit, versions of Opera)</p>
        <p>-ms- (Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge)</p>
        <p>-webkit-border-after</p>
        <p>-o-border-after</p>
        <p>-ms-border-after</p>
        <p>border-after</p>
