        <h4>Ans.</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1) Faster Page Speed. More code means slower page speed.</li>
            <li>2) Better User Experience. CSS not only makes web pages easy on the eye, it also allows for
                user-friendly formatting.</li>
            <li>3) Quicker Development Time.</li>
            <li>4) Easy Formatting Changes.</li>
            <li>5) Compatibility Across Devices. </li>

        <h3>Que.2 What are the disadvantages of CSS?</h3>
        <h4>Ans.</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1) Confusion due to many CSS levels. Beginners are more vulnerable to this issue.</li>
            <li>2) Cross-Browser Issues. Different browsers work differently.</li>
            <li>3) Security Issues. Security is important in today's world driven by technology and data.</li>
            <li>4) Extra Work for Developers.</li>

        <h3>Que.3 What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3?</h3>
        <h4>Ans.</h4>
        <p>CSS3 has compatibility with external font styles through google fonts and typecast. It was not possible with
            earlier CSS1 and CSS2. The selectors in CSS3 has increased while CSS1 and CSS2 only had simple selectors.
            CSS1 AND CSS2 didn't have provision to specifically design the web layout.</p>

        <h3>Que.4 Name a few CSS style components</h3>
        <h4>Ans.</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1) The components of css style are.</li>
            <li>2) Selector: class name, id name or element name that is target.</li>
            <li>3) Attribute: name of the attribute you want to style for example border, color,background, position
                etc.
            </li>
            <li>4) Value of Property: value that will be assigned to attribute.</li>

    <div class="five">
        <h3>Que.5 What do you understand by CSS opacity?</h3>
        <h4>Ans.</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1) The opacity CSS property sets the opacity of an element. Opacity is the degree to which content
                behind
                an element is hidden, and is the opposite of transparency.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="six">
        <h3>Que.6 How can the background color of an element be changed?</h3>
        <h4>Ans.</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1) Approach: The background-color property of CSS is used to set the background of an element. We can
                set
                background color by selecting the element by its class name of id name and then apply the
                background-color property on it to set the background color.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="saveen">
        <h3>Que.7 How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?</h3>
        <h4>Ans.</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1) This task can be achieved by using the background-repeat property that will help us to control the
                repetition of the image. The background-repeat property in CSS is used to repeat the background image
                both horizontally and vertically. It also decides whether the background image will be repeated or not.
            </li>

    <div class="eight">
        <h3>Que.8 What is the use of the background-position property?
        </h3>
        <h4>Ans.</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1) The background-position property sets the starting position of a background image. Tip: By default, a
                background-image is placed at the top-left corner of an element, and repeated both vertically and
                horizontally.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="nine">
        <h3>Que.9 Which property controls the image scroll in the background?</h3>
        <h4>Ans.</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1) The background-attachment property sets whether a background image scrolls with the rest of the page,
                or
                is fixed.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="ten">
        <h3>Que.10 Why should background and color be used as separate properties?</h3>
        <h4>Ans.</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1) Why background and color are the separate properties if they should always be set together? There are
                two reasons behind this: It enhances the legibility of style sheets. The background property is a
                complex property in CSS, and if it is combined with color, the complexity will further increase.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="eleven">
        <h3>Que.11 How to center block elements using CSS1?</h3>
        <h4>Ans.</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1) To centrally align the block elements, we can simply make use of the center> tag. All the elements
                within the center> tag will be centrally aligned.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="twelve">
        <h3>Que.12 How to maintain the CSS specifications?</h3>
        <h4>Ans.</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1) The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type
                (MIME
                type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998).</li>

    </div>
    <div class="tharteen">
        <h3>Que.13 What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page?</h3>
        <h4>Ans.</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1) CSS may be added to HTML in three different ways. To style a single HTML element on the page, use
                Inline
                CSS in a style attribute. By adding CSS to the head section of our HTML document, we can embed an
                internal stylesheet. We can also connect to an external stylesheet that separates our CSS from our HTML.

    </div>
    <div class="fourteen">
        <h3>Que.14 What is embedded style sheets?</h3>
        <h4>Ans.</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1) Embedded Stylesheet: It allows you to define styles for a particular HTML document as a whole in one
                place. This is done by embedding the style Tag style tags containing the CSS properties in the head of
                your document.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="fifteen">
        <h3>Que.15 What are the external style sheets?</h3>
        <h4>Ans.</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1) An external style sheet is a separate CSS file that can be accessed by creating a link within the
                head
                section of the webpage. Multiple webpages can use the same link to access the stylesheet. The link to an
                external style sheet is placed within the head section of the page.</li>
